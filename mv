mv is used to either rename or move files and directories from one place, to another.

To move files from one directory to another, the following convention should be used:

mv file1 /desktop/directory1

here, file1 is being moved from it’s current directory (source) to it’s new position in directory1 (target) and the old file is removed.

If a target directory is not specified, the file or directory will be renamed.

e.g. mv file1 file2

file1 will be renamed to file2.
