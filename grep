grep is used to find instances or patterns of something within a file, or directory.

The syntax is:

grep [options] [search_string file]

e.g. grep ‘hello' test1

This example will find all instances of ‘hello’ in the file test1.

A number of options can be appended to the grep search to make it more specific.

e.g. grep -R ‘hello’ ~desktop/projects

-R (recursive) indicates that grep will search every subdirectory and file within the projects directory

-i (case insensitive) tells grep to ignore cases e.g. will find HELLO, hello, and hELLo

To search using a combination of options using the pipe symbol | to separate your search options

e.g. grep -R | -i
